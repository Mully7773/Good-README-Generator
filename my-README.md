# Good-README-Generator
This is a README generator I helped make using node.js and npm


## Introduction:
I made a README generator that generates a README based on user input.
In the terminal, users are asked a series of questions which are printed to a README that utilizes markdown.

5. Tell me about the contribution guidelines.
